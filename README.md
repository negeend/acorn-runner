# acorn-runner

A game program coded in Python 3 with a game and solver component

### Game outline:

You are an acorn, heir to the Honourable Furious Forest Throne. Your beauty shines like no other, reflecting the colourful solar rays into the eyes of all spectators. But instead of your usual coat of beautiful acorn shell, you find yourself covered in ash. Not only that, but you've fallen great depths from the heights of the towering trees of the Honourable Furious Forest that once cared for you.

You shed a tear of loss. The horrid memories of the Fire Nation's invasion flash before you as you relive the moments your hometown, the Honourable Furious Forest, was burnt to ashes. Your friends, the koalas and kangaroos, your family, the Honourable Furious Forest members, all burnt to a crisp.

Mustering up your motivation for revenge, you, the acorn, heir to the Honourable Furious Forest Throne, stumble forward and find yourself in a maze. You observe walls of fire, helicopter search lights and teleporting pads within.

You cry out and slam your little acorn fist on the greyed Honourable Furious Forest floor of dried up leaves. You swear upon your Father's name, Lord Scarlet Oak of the Honourable Furious Forest, that you will conquer this maze and restore the Honourable Furious Forest back to its former glory of rainbow and sunshine.
